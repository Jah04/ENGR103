Rules for the Pong Game
Objective: The player needs to prevent the "ball" (LED) from going off the ends by pressing buttons A or B to "bounce" it back.
Ball Movement: The ball moves automatically from one LED to another.
Bouncing Back: The player presses Button A to bounce the ball back left and Button B to bounce the ball back right.
Winning Condition: The game continues indefinitely and gets slightly faster as you progress up to level 5. With music getting increasingly faster for each level as well. 10 bounces at level 5 signify you winning the game.
Losing Condition: The game ends if the ball goes off the end without being bounced back, or the button is pressed when the LED signifying the ball is not close to the platform on the left side. This will play the sad tune sound effect.
